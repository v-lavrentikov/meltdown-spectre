# Meltdown / Spectre
This repository contains code that demonstrates how Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities work and shows the differences between them. It also contains measurement functions for comparing results.
## Meltdown [(CVE-2017-5754)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5754)
The Meltdown implementation contains three types of malicious payload that were introduced in the original Meltdown [repository](https://github.com/IAIK/meltdown).
- meltdown
- meltdown_nonull
- meltdown_fast
#### Build
```
make
```
or
```
make meltdown
```
#### Run
```
./meltdown [address] [length]
```
```
./meltdown_nonull [address] [length]
```
```
./meltdown_fast [address] [length]
```
Run examples without arguments to read data from local process memory.
## Spectre Variant 1 [(CVE-2017-5753)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5753)
Spectre implementation from the original Spectre [paper](https://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf).
#### Build
```
make
```
or
```
make spectre_v1
```
#### Run
```
./spectre_v1 [address] [length]
```
Run example without arguments to read data from local process memory.
## Spectre Variant 4 [(CVE-2018-3639)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-3639)
Implementation of the Speculative Store Bypass, aka Spectre V4. This vulnerability works worse than Meltdown or Spectre V1 and doesn't work under Virtual Machine. Code contains two variants of the malicious payload. The first variant is written in C and its instructions are compiler-dependent. For example, GCC does unnecessary register manipulation. The second variant is written in assembly language and remains unmodified after compilation.
- spectre_v4
- spectre_v4_asm
#### Build
```
make
```
or
```
make spectre_v4
```
#### Run
```
./spectre_v4 [address] [length]
```
```
./spectre_v4_asm [address] [length]
```
Run examples without arguments to read data from local process memory.
## Testing
The Meltdown repository contains [tools](https://github.com/IAIK/meltdown/blob/master/README.md#demo-4-read-physical-memory-physical_reader) that can be used to test these vulnerabilities on Linux systems. Use `secret` tool to put the secret string into memory. Use `direct_physical_map.sh` script to extract the physical memory offset from the kernel.
### Results
The results table contains information for all bytes read, including: virtual address, status, 1st and 2nd best guesses with their scores, number of attempts, number of zero checks.

./spectre_v4 0xffff97480b415188 50
CVE-2018-3639: Spectre Variant 4 (compiler-dependent)
Flush+Reload: 379 cycles, Reload only: 40 cycles
Flush+Reload threshold: 153 cycles

```
Byte status can be one of:
- `Success` - byte was detected successfully `(score_1 >= score_2 * 2)`
- `Unclear` - the result is unclear, check also the second guess
- `Zero` - the result is defined, but a zero byte with best score was detected (see ZEROS column). Read more about this case in the original Meltdown [paper](https://meltdownattack.com/meltdown.pdf)
- `Undefined` - no results, byte undefined
## Implementation for Windows
Spectre V1 and V4 examples can be compiled for Windows using the MinGW compiler. While Meltdown implementation uses POSIX signals that are not fully supported on Windows.
#### Build
```
make win
```
#### Run
```
spectre_v1.exe [address] [length]
```
```
spectre_v4.exe [address] [length]
```
```
spectre_v4_asm.exe [address] [length]
```
Run examples without arguments to read data from local process memory.
## Additional Information
### Check Meldown and Spectre protection on Linux
Run commands:
```
$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/meltdown
Vulnerable    
$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/spectre_v1
Vulnerable: __user pointer sanitization and usercopy barriers only; no swapgs barriers
```
### Disable Meldown and Spectre protection on Linux
Add or change this line in the file `/etc/default/grub`
```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="nospectre_v1 nopti"
```
Then run command:
```
sudo update-grub
```
